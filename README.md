[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/982008348.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15848681)

Documentation, raw data, processed data and code to reproduce the quantitative assessment that supports 
the Antarctic fur seal IUCN Red List Assessment for 2025.

(or via browser: https://github.com/JaumeForcada/Antarctic-fur-seal-IUCN-Assessment-2025/blob/main/documentation/AFSIUCN2025Assessment.docx)

This is a large document, and in both cases the best is to download it (e.g., by selecting the "Raw File" link or other download options).

This is a hybrid manuscript, which contains a data analysis in support and justification of the Red List assessment, and 
the quantitative population assessment of the species that assigns Red List Categories to species and subpopulations,
and the justification for these.

## Reproducing the analysis

If required, go to: 

Antarctic-fur-seal-IUCN-Assessment-2025/code/README.md

to find instructions to reproduce the analysis described in "AFSIUCN2025Assessment.docx" or verify aspects of the code.

An RStudio project 'Antarctic fur seal IUCN Assessment 2025.Rproj' can be used to facilitate execution, allowing to navigate 
through data folders
